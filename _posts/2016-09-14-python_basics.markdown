### List and Dictionaries
Lists will contain every type of data
<br>This is due to the usage of link-array rather than simple array 
<br>Interpret Languages such as javascript and Python use list as a linked array

``` python
# an empty list
empty=[]

# list of numbers
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40.5]

# list of strings
words ] ['cheerio', 'cheers', 'wacha', 'hiya']

# list of mixed items
anything = [10, 'hello', 'ahoy', 123.5]
```
