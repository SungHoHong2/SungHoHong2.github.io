### what is django

django is an open-source MVC framework written in Python for building web application
<br> Today, most web applications including Django send data to the server to validate, process and render HTML 

1. User requests a URL
2. Django process (Controller)
3. Validation (Model)
4. Django process (Controller)
5. Rendering (Template)
6. User views the HTML

<br> By making this progress with seperate components makes it easier to maintain and collaborate on the project 

<br>

### Django Framework
The validation, rendering, processing is taken care of by seperate components in Django
<br> Django is called MTV rathern than MVC because it has Model, Template and View

1. User
2. View <Controller> (Process data)
3. Model (Stores and Validate data) 
4. Template (Renders HTML)
