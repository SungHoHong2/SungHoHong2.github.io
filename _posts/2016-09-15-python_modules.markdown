### Functions
functions are useful when developers are repeating the 
<br> same type of algorithms over and over again 
<br>_functions are mini programs that perform a specific task_

1. Name of the function
2. Arguments of the function
3. Returns of the function 

``` python 

def average(prices):
	total = 0
	for num in prices:
		total += num
	avg = total / len(numbers)	
	return avg

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
my_average = average(numbers)
print(my_average)

```
