<h2>Turning point of my life</h2>

When I was studying design in some prestigious university in Korea, <br>
I have to admit, life was very easy at then. <br>
Just follow the rules and you will end up working in a prestigious company. <br>

<br>

I thought that was the answer, and studied hard all the way to the path. <br>
At the point when I was a fresh employee in the job market, <br>
I begin to question why I started studying art in the first place. <br>

<br>

It may sound like odd but ... <br>
I wanted to design the Holy Bible in a way that no artists have ever done before. <br>

I wanted to surpass the editorial or interactive design that artists have already tried countless times. <br>
I want to use ingredients like high performance computing, and embedded systems to express the reason why mankind exists <br>

<br>

<h4> That's the reason why I switched to Computer Science </h4>

<br>


Life is difficult since I have to start from the very beginning. <br>
The path to working in good companies are closed since I switched my career to computer science. <br>
I do regret sometimes, especially when I have to meet up with my friends who are already seniors in some organization <br>

<br>
