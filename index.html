<h2>Turning point of my life</h2>

My goal was not to work for my entire life ... <br>
The art university seemed to provide me with that solution <br>
Just follow the rules and you will end up tings that you do as a hobby even in a company. <br>

<br>

I thought that was the answer, and studied hard to follow their curriculum. <br>
At the point when I was a professional in a advertising industry, satisfying clients' demands <br>
I begin to question am I really doing things that I do as for a hobby? <br>

<br>

It may sound like nonsense but ... <br>
My hobby was to pursue <strong>Art</strong> by experimenting the tools that no artists have ever used before. <br>

I wanted to surpass the paints, brushes, and software design tools that artists have already tried countless times. <br>
I wanted to express art in realtime with <strong> cloud computation </strong> and <strong> circuits </strong> <br>

<br>

That's the reason why I switched to <strong>Computer Science </strong> <br>
And as a novice in the field of Computer Science, the job market was kicking my ass ever since

Life became difficult since I have to start learning from the very beginning. <br>
The path to working in good companies are closed since I switched my career to computer science. <br>
I do regret sometimes, especially when I have to meet up with my friends who are already seniors in art industries <br>

<br>

But at the same time, I understand that it is a small price to pay  <br>
to do things that I only want to do and am grateful <br>
that I sense no  distinction between  <strong> work & hobby </strong> after changing my career.

<br>

<strong> Our life span is too short to do things like working for living </strong>
