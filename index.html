<h2>Turning point of my life</h2>

My life long rule is to only engage on hobbies I am passionate about ... <br>
Studying art seemed to provide me the solution <br>
Just follow the rules and you will end up doing things that you want to do in a big stable company. <br>

<br>

At the point when I was a professional designer in a advertising industry <br>
I found myself not pursuing my passion but managing artists and dealing projects that only satisfy clients' demands
I begin to question whether I am really doing things that I do <br>

<br>

It may sound like far fetched but ... <br>
My hobby was to pursue <strong>Art</strong> by experimenting tools that no artists have ever used before. <br>

I wanted to surpass the paints, brushes, and software design tools that artists have already tried countless times. <br>
I wanted to express art in realtime with <strong> cloud computation </strong> and <strong> circuits </strong> <br>

<br>

That's the reason why I switched to <strong>Computer Science </strong> <br>
And as a novice in the field of Computer Science, the job market was busting my ass like my artwork below<br>

Life became difficult since I have to start learning from the very beginning. <br>
The path to working in good companies are closed since I switched my career to computer science. <br>
I do regret sometimes, especially when I have to meet up with my friends who are already seniors in art industries <br>

<br>

But at the same time, I understand that it is a small price to pay  <br>
to do things that I only want to do and am grateful <br>
that I sense no  distinction between  <strong> work & hobby </strong> after changing my career. <br>
